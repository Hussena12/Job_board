// This file simply exports an empty object or nothing.
// It will serve as a placeholder for modules that are not needed in the browser.
export default {};
// If the error explicitly mentions other named exports (e.g., SourceMapConsumer), add them too:
export const SourceMapGenerator = {};
// export const SourceMapConsumer = {}; // Uncomment if needed based on error
